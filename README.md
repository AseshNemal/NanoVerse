# NanoVerse

NanoVerse is an immersive 3D educational app for visionOS, designed to let users explore microscopic biological worlds (like cells, DNA, viruses) and import their own 3D models. The app leverages Apple's latest spatial computing technologies to provide interactive, narrated, and visually rich experiences.

---

## Features

- **Immersive 3D Scenes**: Explore built-in biological models (White Blood Cell, DNA, Virus) in a fully immersive environment.
- **Model Import**: Import your own `.usdz` 3D models from local files or HTTPS URLs.
- **Scene & Model Management**: Switch between built-in and imported models. Only one imported model is shown at a time in the immersive view, but you can switch instantly.
- **Custom Voice Narration**: Add, edit, or delete custom narration for each scene. Narration is played using AVSpeechSynthesizer.
- **Dashboard & Controls**: Quick actions for entering/exiting immersive space, changing scenes, importing models, and resetting models. Transform controls for scale, position, and rotation.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for model import failures, unsupported formats, and network issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift & SwiftUI**: Main programming language and UI framework.
- **RealityKit**: 3D rendering, animation, and interaction.
- **AVFoundation**: Text-to-speech narration.
- **Combine**: State and event management.
- **visionOS APIs**: Immersive space, spatial navigation, and 3D interaction.
